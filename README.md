# WPFControls
WPFControls contains some simple controls which can be used in WPF projects.
Their usage is best described by the tests which are included in the project.

These controls are used in my other projects [Dopamine](https://github.com/digimezzo/Dopamine) and [Knowte](https://github.com/digimezzo/Knowte).
